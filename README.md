# GDSC-Backend-Class
To make this application I used html, vanila css and javascript. The sturcture follows a basic calculator first then a BMI calculater which were both implemented separately. All functions are implemented in the script tag. The basic calculator can perform basic arithemetic operations. BMI calculator receives input(height and weight) from users to calculate their BMI and display the result. Uses DOM maniputation to update/display the results. Challenges faced would be shortening the code, original version was much bulky and repetitive.
